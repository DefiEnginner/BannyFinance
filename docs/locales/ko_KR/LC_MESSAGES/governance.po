"BUNNY holders control the ecosystem and receive the majority of farm "
"performance fee profits. In order to claim these profits, BUNNY holders "
"stake their tokens in the BUNNY Governance Pool. Profits are sent to this"
" pool in the form of BNB rewards. The amount of profits you recieve is "
"determined by the number of BUNNY tokens you stake (%of the pool) you "
"own. Later on, these governance tokens will be used to vote on decisions "
"within our community. Thus the more BUNNY you stake, the higher your "
"influence in the ecosystem."
