"The BUNNY token doesn’t have a max supply. For every 1 BNB earned in the "
"performance fees, 10 BUNNY is minted, so supply is not capped at the "
"moment. We may establish new strategies to limit the cap or burn some "
"tokens, however currently we are focused on the growth of the BUNNY "
"token. You can earn BUNNY by using the farms, or you can buy BUNNY "
"through our zap function. Roughly 13% of all BUNNY mints will go towards "
"development to ensure rapid innovation."

"Honest $cake Farmers: Deposit CAKE-BNB LP and reap the benefits of the "
"compounding effect. With Simple Interest, the APY is 150% for CAKE-BNB, "
"however, if this gets compounded it becomes 347% APY. The assumptions are"
" the following: 1) initial capital is $1m, 2) transaction cost: $1, "
"3)Compounded Once Daily. The transaction cost assumes it takes 4-5 steps "
"for Pancake Bunny to compound deposits. Around 25% of Bunny’s profits "
"will be bonuses. Some percent of the farming profits will be saved as BNB"
" in the BUNNY Reward Pool."

"Degens: Buy BUNNY at the start of launch. Sell when the price becomes "
"high enough to fulfill your greedy desire. The Probability of BUNNY "
"dropping below the initial price of $3 is very low. 1) Presale "
"Participants bought BUNNY at $3 and will not sell below that price at a "
"loss. 2) As BUNNY Price goes up, Bunny issued volume will decrease."

"Smart Investors: Stake BUNNY long-term. The APY of BUNNY Pool is amazing "
"and real! The meaning of BUNNY Pool’s APY 100% is if you buy $10 worth of"
" BUNNY now and stake it for 1 year, you will receive $10 worth of BNB. If"
" you sell the remaining BUNNY on the market, you can also capitalize on "
"profits there. If you are a wise investor, you would meticulously analyze"
" the APY of the staking pool and earn profits not only from the BNB "
"rewards, but also from selling the BUNNY as well."
