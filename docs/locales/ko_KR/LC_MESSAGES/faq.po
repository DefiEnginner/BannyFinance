"PancakeBunny is a new and rapidly growing DeFi yield aggregator that is "
"used for PancakeSwap. The PancakeBunny protocol empowers farmers to "
"leverage their yield-seeking tendencies to optimize yield compounding "
"strategy on BSC. We are providing strategies for the various needs of "
"farmers from the highest yield seekers to the risk reward optimizing "
"smart investors."

"We wanted to create a platform that automatically compounds yields for "

"Every Farm requires a different LP Token. Furthermore the different Farms"

"Let’s assume the APR of the CAKE farm is 365%. This means that on average"

"following calculation: (1+0.01)^365 - 1 = 3678% Keep in mind that this is"
" an assumption that only holds true if the APR of CAKE farm stays "
"constant through one year. However, this is obviously not the case since "
"the APY also changes by the second. We can use the same calculation for "
"the rest of the Farms as well! Just divide the APR by 365, which would be"

"This strategy is truly unique and advantageous since the principal "
