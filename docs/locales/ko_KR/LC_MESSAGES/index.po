"Our Bunny team is dedicated to support the underlying DeFi ecosystem by "
"providing users with an easy way to automatically compound their yields "
"through the Binance Smart Chain. The DeFi movement, and more specifically"
" Yield Aggregators, have seen a huge surge in activity in 2020. The Rise "
"of Yearn, which uses existing protocols such as Compound, DyDx, and "
"Curve, has influenced the development of various other Yield Aggregator "
"projects on the Ethereum Network. Our goal is to expand that same "
"interest through the Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem."

"A key difference in Yield Farming on Binance Smart Chain is the low gas "
"fee. This makes it much easier for small players and ordinary individuals"
" to enter the DeFi space and still get a good share of the crops with "
"small amounts of capital. Through automation, Bunny allows individuals to"
" reap the benefits of compounding without any additional steps. Bunny "
"calculates the most optimal compounding frequency and automatically "
"compounds your tokens through smart contracts."

"Bunny, like other yield aggregators on BSC, uses Pancake Swap since it is"
" the most prominent platform for Yield Farming. Bunny is continuously "
"striving to create innovative new Yield Optimization Strategies. "
"Currently we have BUNNY, CAKE, BUNNY-BNB, CAKE-BNB BUSD-BNB, USDT-BNB, "
"DAI-BNB, USDC-BNB, VAI-BUSD, USDT-BUSD Pools. Furthermore, on our "
"website, you can see we have the maximizer vaults. These strategies allow"
" users to get the profits from certain pools and these profits are "
"automatically auto compounded into the CAKE compounding pool, giving "
"users a much greater return, while protecting the principal. We are "
"currently launching our cross chain project, which will allow ETH-BSC "
"cross chain, bringing more ETH users on bsc yield farming as well."
