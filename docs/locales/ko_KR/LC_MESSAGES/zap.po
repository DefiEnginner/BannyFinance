"The Zap feature we added essentially allows for a user to directly switch"
" from single asset (BNB) to an LP Token (BNB-CAKE LP), with just a click "
"of a button without having to go to pancake swap and switch out different"
" assets. Users can also just switch between different assets, for "
"example, BNB to BUNNY. There is no additional fee for this zap; we built "
"this tool for the convenience of users."
