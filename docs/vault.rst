APR & APY
================================================

Letâ€™s assume the APY of the CAKE farm is 365%. This means that on average if we divide 365% by 365 days, we get a daily return of 1%. Now since Bunny compounds this 1%, we can estimate the compounded APR using the following calculation: (1+0.01)^365 - 1 = 3678% Keep in mind that this is an assumption that only holds true if the APR of CAKE farm stays constant through one year. However, this is obviously not the case since the APY also changes by the second. We can use the same calculation for the rest of the Farms as well! Just divide the APY by 365, which would be the average daily yield. (1+daily yield)^365 -1 = Compounded APR. A new strategy we are releasing is putting the daily yields from the Stable Coin-BNB Farms, into the CAKE compounding pools. The Stable Coin-BNB Farms have a current APY of 30%, but if we use this new strategy the APY increases to about 150%. This strategy is truly unique and advantageous since the principal investment does not get touched, and only the extra yields from the farm get invested in the more volatile, high risk-high reward CAKE pool.
