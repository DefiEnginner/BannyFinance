Bunny is launching a brand new innovative yield maximizing strategy through our farms. For each existing farm (CAKE-BNB, BUSD-BNB, USDT-BNB, DAI-BNB, USDC-BNB, USDT-BUSD) We will add a new integrated farm that takes the CAKE yields that comes out of the farm and invests in the CAKE compounding pool. Essentially this would be a way to reap the benefits of the CAKE auto-compounding farm without touching the actual principal deposits which would still be in one of the other farms. The APY would also increase significantly, but the risk of losing the principal amount due to CAKE volatility wouldn’t exist.

According to our test calculations, assuming that CAKE price stays constant,USDT-BNB Farm APY is 30%, and CAKE APR is 300%, then the APY of someone who deposits into the “Yield Maximizing USDT-BNB Farm” would be 189.9%. This is much higher than the 30% achieved by simply compounding USDT-BNB, yet the risk is very minimal. The only risks would be if CAKE price drops significantly, or if the CAKE APR drops as well. That being said even if the CAKE price drops significantly the principal amount invested in USDT and BNB would still be the same. Similar to our regular farms, in order to fully benefit from the compounding effect, a user must have the patience to sit back and watch their money grow exponentially over time. One small complication is that because of the way the new yield maximized farms are coded through back end development, the yields earned daily (24 hour period) get distributed the next day on a rolling cycle. This means that users who deposit from day 0 to day 1 would be at a slight disadvantage as they would not be able to receive their fair share of yields for the first 24 hours. To mitigate this effect we plan on giving these early users some BUNNY to compensate for the lost yields.
The graph below illustrates the difference in returns between the original Stable-BNB farm and the new Yield Maximizing Stable-BNB farm.
